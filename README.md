Airline Satisfaction Rating Prediction Model
Various airlines conduct flight satisfaction surveys with a list of service items to derive which content passengers would appreciate in their traveling experience. However, the raw numerical outcome could be thoroughly sophisticated or ambiguous to extract the authentic essence of the feedback. Therefore, in this project, we aim to diagnose which service factors are among the most that affect clientsâ€™ reflection by diverse predictive models and provide practical suggestions on methods to improve the quality of service.
